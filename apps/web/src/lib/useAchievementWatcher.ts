 * Announces a badge the moment it's earned, wherever you are in the app.
 *
 * The badges are recomputed from the same /api/insights the Stats page reads,
 * refreshed on focus and every couple of minutes while the tab is visible,
 * and compared with the server's record of what has already been unlocked.
 * A badge is toasted only after the server has stored it, so a failed save
 * retries on the next refresh rather than announcing it again.
 *
 * On the very first run everything already earned is recorded silently —
 * a year of history should not arrive as twenty toasts.
