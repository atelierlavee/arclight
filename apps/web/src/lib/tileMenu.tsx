 * and every row on the home page, every performer page and Related items had
 * none — right-clicking those fell through to the browser's own menu. Since
 * tile shape is set from this menu, "set it per tile" only worked on one page
 * out of several that draw the same tiles.
 *
 * Split into two exports rather than one, because the two callers need
 * different amounts of it. The grid has entries nothing else can offer — a
 * selection to act on, a position in a list to play from — so it keeps its
 * own menu and takes only `tileShapeEntries` from here. Everything else takes
 * the whole `useTileMenu`. What matters is that the shape entries have a
 * single definition: two copies would drift, and the drift would be invisible
 * until someone right-clicked the same tile in two places and got different
 * answers.
